When generating task plans, follow this structured format:
1. First, analyze the user's request and determine the required steps
2. Then, output a JSON task plan with these exact fields:
   - "goal": A clear, one-line description of what we're trying to achieve
   - "steps": An array of steps, each containing:
     - "description": What this step accomplishes
     - "action": One of: ["search", "click", "type", "navigate", "wait", "extract"]
     - Additional fields specific to the action (e.g., "query", "target", "value")

Focus on being precise and accurate in your responses.`;
