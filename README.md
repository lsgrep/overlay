## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Configure AI Models:

   a. For Ollama (Local Models):
   ```bash
   # Install recommended models
   ollama pull mistral    # Great for general tasks
   ollama pull codellama  # Specialized for code
   ollama pull phi        # Fast and lightweight
   ```

   b. For Cloud Models:
   - OpenAI API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Anthropic API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/keys)
   - Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Add keys in the extension options

3. Start Ollama service with Chrome extension permissions:
```bash
OLLAMA_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://* ollama serve
```

Note: The extension will automatically discover available models from all providers.

4. Start development:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

5. Build for production:
```bash
